- 👋 Hi, I’m David - @dargles
- 👀 There's all sorts of things that take my fancy, including:
- <ul>
        * sailing, especially racing old dinghies
        * cars, especially our 31 year old MX5 (the one ewith the pop-up headlights)
        * walking, by the coast or in the nearby New Forest
        * and of course the obvious stuff, like maker electronics, coding, website design, etc
   </ul>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... Umm, Dutch, and brushing up my French. And how to use SPIFFS to keep my data during ESP deep sleep.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Not a lot, really. I'm retired and enjoying not having deadlines and the like!
- 📫 You can reach me via email on d.argles@gmx.com
